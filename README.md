Application for AND

The application will be a movie/tv series tracker. There will be a library of movies/tv series you can scroll through and open to get further details about the item.
You can search by name or genre different movies. You can also create an account in order to get more features.
By creating one, you can do the following things and more:
 - Set the number of episodes/seasons you have watched. You can also set it directly as "Completed" or "Plan to watch".
 - Interact with other users, like sending friend requests.
 - Put an item in a "Favourite" list. You can make this list public so your friends can see what you like
 
 I wanted to make this application, because I enjoy watching different shows, and keeping track of everything can be annoying and cumbersome.
 This app can help me and other people with this problem. It can also help on structuring what you plan on watching (so you no longer forget to watch what your friend recommended
