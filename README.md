The application will be a movie tracker. There will be a library of movies you can scroll through and open to get further details about the item.
By creating an account, you can do the following things and more:
 - You can set the movie as "Completed" or "Plan to watch".
 - Put an item in a "Favourite" list.
 
 I wanted to make this application, because I enjoy watching different shows, and keeping track of everything can be annoying and cumbersome.
 This app can help me and other people with this problem. It can also help on structuring what you plan on watching (so you no longer forget to watch what your friend recommended like 5 months ago)
